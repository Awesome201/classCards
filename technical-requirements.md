# Class Cards: Technical Requirements
 We're going to have the user enter a unique ID at the home page if they are interested in our service and once they submit their ID it's going to send them to our profile form where they enter their real name and interests and etc. Once they hit the submit button all their info is being set in the local storage to be compared with other users info. On the results page we're going to get the users information and compare it with our pre-built in users. There is going to be a points system where similarities between users will give points and whoever has the most points will show up as the users best match. Once they are done they can visit our About Us page and view the developers answers for the profile form questions and also read a bio about the developers to and add contact information.
